Learn what's being copied off your website and how you can leverage this behaviour to get more traffic, more often.

== Description ==

How would you like to know who's copying content from your website and turn those users into return visitors?

We found a wonderful website called Tynt a few weeks back and we fell in love with the tool, the reports and the functionality but found it a little difficult to impliment for the average user so we built the Tynt Insight Plugin for WordPress, a free downloadable tool that allows you to easily add Tynt's amazing copy & paste functionality onto any website.

Want to see it in action? Simply copy from this website and paste it into a new document, presto, a link appears back to the source page you copied from!

With the Tynt Insight Plugin for WordPress, you can easily add Tynt to any WordPress blog or website as quickly and easily as other popular API platforms such as WP Stats or Askimet, just copy and paste the API data into your Tynt Insight Plugin for WordPress control panel and you're ready to go!
